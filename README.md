# File Encryption/Decryption

## Description
This program allows users to encrypt or decrypt the contents of a text file using a simple encryption algorithm. It prompts the user to choose between encryption or decryption and input the file name or path. The program then encrypts or decrypts the file accordingly and saves the result to a new file.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the program is located.
3. Run the program using the appropriate command for your programming language (e.g., `python encryption.py`, `java Encryption`, etc.).
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose between encryption or decryption and provide the file name or path.
5. After the encryption or decryption process is complete, the program will save the result to a new file.

## Encryption Algorithm
The encryption algorithm used in this program is a simple substitution cipher. It replaces each character in the text with another character based on a fixed key.
